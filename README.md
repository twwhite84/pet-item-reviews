# Pet Item Reviews
This is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web app developed for a Massey University assignment. The project demonstrates a basic understanding of MVC architecture, relational databases and the .NET Core framework.

To run the app on a local development server, install Visual Studio, .NET Core 3.1, SQL Express and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). Apply the migrations and seed the database with an initial entry using "dotnet ef database update". Then open the solution file in Visual Studio and run in debug mode. If the ports used are unavailable, they can be edited in launchSettings.json.
